                    <h2>Aim of the Project</h2>
                    <p>In contrast to more conventional assets like gold and the S&P 500, the project seeks to evaluate the Hermès Birkin bag's potential as a financial investment. In order to determine if luxury handbags can be reliable, profitable investments, this study examines price growth, inflation-adjusted values, volatility, and cumulative returns. The study also looks into how market demand, exclusivity, and scarcity affect Birkin bags' worth over time, providing information on their place in diverse portfolios.</p>

                    <h2>Data Used</h2>
                    <p>PurseBop, Baghunter, and other premium resale websites provided the data on Birkin bags. Nasdaq and MacroTrends were used to retrieve historical S&P 500 and gold values. MacroTrends and IMF projections were used to determine inflation rates. Python's pandas module was used at Google Colab to handle the data for cleaning, adjusting for inflation, and computing cumulative returns. All datasets were transformed into standardized formats for analysis, and automated scripts guaranteed replicability.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges in Data Cleaning and Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The inconsistent Birkin bag pricing data, which resulted from model-specific variances and a lack of public records, was a major obstacle. Average prices for similar models were determined in order to resolve this. Accurate historical rates had to be sourced for inflation adjustments, and currency disputes were settled by converting to USD. Using Python packages, Google Colab offered a productive environment for data cleansing and standardization.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Birkin Bags:</strong> Nominal growth is steady, but real returns decline after 2021 due to inflation. A slight recovery is seen in 2024.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>S&P 500:</strong> Significant nominal growth but declining real value, reflecting market volatility and inflationary impact.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Gold:</strong> Stable in real terms, reinforcing its role as a hedge during inflationary periods.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    This analysis underscores the importance of inflation adjustments for understanding true asset performance. While Birkin bags offer steady growth, inflation dampens real gains. Gold remains stable, and the S&P 500 shows potential but suffers from volatility.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In terms of stability and returns, Birkin bags do better than gold and the S&P 500. Due to their great demand and exclusivity, they expand steadily, have little volatility, and are resistant to market swings. Stocks are more volatile even though they have more room for growth. Although it offers stability, gold yields little profit. According to the research, Birkin bags are a good substitute investment for diversification and wealth accumulation.</p>
